  * Each unique piece placed from the `None` category is addititve to total comfort

## Instructions

  * Nearest similar shows distance to **the nearest piece in the same category**. It may be a lower comfort value than the selectd piece.
  * Color on comfort values indicates that selected piece is
    * green - maximum comfort for that category
    * red - minimum comfort for that category
    * orange - neither max nor min
    * white - None category is not colorized as each piece is additive
