### Armor Slots

  * Armor slots for items place in the bottom row of the new 8x5 inventory grid. 
  * Armor may only be placed here on equip and moved out on unequip
  * Armor will not unequip if there is insufficient inventory space (no empty spots in the original 8x4 inventory grid or 3 quick slots)

### Quick Slots

  * Quick slots are configurable via the F1 configuration manager but default to Z, V, and B for item use
  * GUI will display items in quickslots next to forsaken power. Configurable via configuration manager with F1

### On Death

  * Items in armor slots and quick slots will be placed on a second, smaller grave that spawns on top of the regular player tombstone while the regular inventory will be in the usual 8x4 player grave. This is to avoid issues with unmodded players opening graves and thus deleting items.

### Configuration

  * TBD

## Notes

  * If a character is logged into unmodded after a player save using this mod, any deltas in the inventory between the last modded save and a vanilla save will be overwritten by the last modded save.
  * This is a rework of Randy Knapp's Equipment and Quick Slots mod that looks to fix the issues around item deletion as well as issues around vanilla and modded player interaction. Tombstone handling modeled off Fang86's MoreSlots mod.
