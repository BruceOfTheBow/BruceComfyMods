## About
Adds lots of buildable custom plants. Use the custom item called Shovel to place them. I'll probably keep adding more plants.

## Installation (manual)
Install *BepInEx* and *Jotunn* per the author's instructions.
Move the **PlantIt folder** into your **Valheim\BepInEx\plugins** folder.

## Features
There's a shovel. And some plants. And you use the shovel to place the plants. Have fun!
