# Add All Fuel And Ore For Smelter Charcoal kiln etc

## Features

* You no longer need to press the button repeatedly to get to the furnace.
* When using the facility normally (default: E), fuel is fed one by one.
* When using the facility, pressing the modifier key (default: Left Shift) will load the fuel, etc. in batches.

## Incompatibility

* Mod is currently incompatible with ColorfulPortals v1.5.0 and below unless the _global IsModEnabled is set to false (disabled).

## Description

* If there is no fuel in the player's inventory, fuel can be injected in batches from containers.
* If you want to use this feature, you need to change the settings.

* If a player's inventory and containers do not reveal a valid item when in individual item mode (default E), the other mods will continue to process the item.
* Note that in batch mode (default: Shift Left + E), other mods will not continue to process if an item is not found.

* The unit of batch injection is done per stack.
  * For example, if you have wood (10/50) and wood (20/50) in your inventory, 10 of them will be consumed from your inventory.
  * If you do it again, 20 of them will be consumed.
  * If the fuel limit is less than the stack, only that amount will be consumed.
