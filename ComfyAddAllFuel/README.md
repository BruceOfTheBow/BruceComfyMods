# Comfy Add All Fuel

*Ability to batch add fuel and ore to appropriate places.*

## Features

* You no longer need to press [E]/Interact [1-8]/UseItem buttons repeatedly to add fuel/ore/etc.
* When using the any smelters, cooking stations, or fireplaces the default button-press will operate normally.
* If the modifier-key [Left-Shift] is held on button-press, batch adding will be attempted up to the fuel/ore/food limit.

## Instructions

* The unit of batch injection is done per stack.
* For example:
  * If you have wood (10/50) and wood (20/50) in your inventory, 10 of them will be consumed from your inventory.
  * If you do it again, 20 of them will be consumed.
  * If the fuel limit is less than the stack, only that amount will be consumed.
