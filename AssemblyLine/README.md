# AssemblyLine

*Why make one when you can have an assembly line?*

## Instructions

  * Adds `+` and `-` button to crafting panel for crafting multiple items with one click.
  * Hold `LShift` + click to increment by 10.
  * Hold `LCtrl` + click to increment to max craftable with materials in player inventory.
  * Adds toggle to config to allow first shift + click increment to go from 1 to 10 rather than 1 to 11 so that perfect
    stack sizes are made with fewer clicks.
  * Comfy replacement for MultiCraft by mjdegue.

## Notes

  * Vanilla multi-crafting is **disabled** while AssemblyLine is active.
