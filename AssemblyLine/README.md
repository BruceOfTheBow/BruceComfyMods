# AssemblyLine

  * Why make one when you can have an assembly line?

## Instructions

  * Comfy replacement for MultiCraft by mjdegue.
  * Adds UI elements for selecting a crafting amount to be made while only clicking craft once.
  * Adds toggle to config to allow first shift + click increment to go from 1 to 10 rather than 1 to 11 
  so that perfect stack sizes are made with fewer clicks.

### Manual

  * Un-zip `AssemblyLine.dll` to your `/Valheim/BepInEx/plugins/` folder.

### Thunderstore (manual)
