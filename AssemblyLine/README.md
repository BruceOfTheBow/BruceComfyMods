# AssemblyLine

  * Why make one when you can have an assembly line?

## Instructions
  * Adds `+` and `-` button to crafting panel for crafting multiple items with one click.
  * Hold `Lshift` + click to increment by 10
  * Hold `Lctrl` + click to increment to max craftable with materials in player inventory.
  * Adds toggle to config to allow first shift + click increment to go from 1 to 10 rather than 1 to 11 
  so that perfect stack sizes are made with fewer clicks.
  * Comfy replacement for MultiCraft by mjdegue.
