## About
Adds lots of buildable custom plants. Use the custom item called Shovel to place them. I'll probably keep adding more plants.

## Installation (manual)
Install *BepInEx* and *Jotunn* per the author's instructions.
Move the **PlantIt folder** into your **Valheim\BepInEx\plugins** folder.

## Features
There's a shovel. And some plants. And you use the shovel to place the plants. Have fun!

Thanks to sbtoonz, Gravebear, and RockerKitten for all the help! Couldn't have done it without you guys :D

Thanks to Poly, Dunmr, RockerKitten and Namdinh for the models!
