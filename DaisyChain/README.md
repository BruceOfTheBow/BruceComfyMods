# DaisyChain
Use crafting stations as range extenders for each other

Client side only.

- Daisy chain crafting stations to extend their build range
- When in range of any crafting station that can find a path to another station, build as though you are adjacent
- Build objects requiring forge or stonecutter without needing to build one close by
